# Intfix to Postfix Calculator
 This program takes an arithmetic expression in infix notation as input from the user, converts it to postfix notation, and then evaluates the postfix expression to get the result.
 [Note: this program assumes that the input expression is valid and does not handle errors such as division by zero or invalid characters.]
